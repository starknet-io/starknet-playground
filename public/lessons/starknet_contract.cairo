// [StarkNet](https://starkware.co/product/starknet/) is a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup operating
// as an L2 network over Ethereum, where any dApp can achieve
// unlimited scale for its computation, without compromising
// Ethereum's composability and security.
//
// This is a simple StarkNet contract.
// Note that you won't be able to use the playground to compile and run it,
// but you can deploy it on the [StarkNet Planets Alpha network](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-planets-alpha-on-ropsten-e7494929cb95)!
//
// 1. Click on "Deploy" to deploy the contract.
//    For more information on how to write Cairo contracts see the
//    ["Hello StarkNet" tutorial](https://cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet).
// 2. Click on the contract address in the output pane to open
//    [Starkscan](https://testnet.starkscan.co/) - the StarkNet block explorer.
// 3. Wait for the page to load the information
//    (it may take a few minutes until a block is created).
// 4. In the "STATE" tab, you can call the "add()" transaction.

// The "%lang" directive declares this code as a StarkNet contract.
